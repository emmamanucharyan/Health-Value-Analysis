  Health Value Analysis will help answer this problem by letting the user answer twelve questions. After answering these questions, the user will know their health utility index, Health utility index measures health-related quality of  life, not just health. It is calculated with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) which involve the quantity and quality of life and ranges from 1(perfect health) to 0(death). A year of life lived in perfect health is worth 1 QALY.
	
  The user will have their index number compared to the median index of Americans. They will also be able to compare their health quality to the amount of money they regularly spend on health care and see if they get their money's worth. After subscribing, the user can compare their health quality with the money they spend on their lifestyle.Later,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            they will receive consultations from a professional economist, who will research their healthcare details.
